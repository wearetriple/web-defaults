# Web Defaults - code convention

We like React because it’s a less opinionated framework that lets you configure a lot. This makes you able to create different patterns for similair solutions. This flexibility can be very practical, but the downside is that its harder to keep a consistent structure while the application keeps expanding and the team of developers starts growing. We’re creating our own convention to be able to maintain that structure and ensure that the structure is for 80/90% the same on every project within our company. Our goal is to improve the following points:

- developer transitions to other projects should be easier
- sharing solutions and components between projects should be easier
- less discussion about the implementation and more focus on the business logic
- centralised knowledge sharing and improvement of code quality

## How strict are we going to use this convention?

This is the hardest part in order to make this convention a success. We have to create a starting point and some of the rules and conventions will be different that your current way of working. This can feel intrusive. We **urge** you to **follow this convention as strictly as possible**. You will have to let go of your own preferences on certain topics/rules and stick to the convention.

## What if I don't like something?

If there is anything you’d like improve or change, make it a centralised discussion (within the web weekly) and see if you can improve it within the convention so that everyone can benefit from it.

## What if something can't be applied to my project?

If you need to change a rule or a pattern so that it works for your project, then make sure you keep those desicions centralised within a **extended convention** for your project. This ensures that your project still remains structured.
