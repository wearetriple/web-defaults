# ðŸ“¦ Dependencies

Using third-party packages can be great within your project. Who wants to reinvent the wheel when you can `npm install` it in 2 seconds? For security and performance reasons, we should think twice before using just any package.

For every new package, we must carefully check **Quality**, **Security**, and **Stability**. Below is a list of things you should consider.

**Must**

- Come from a reputable registry like NPM
- Be checked with peers within Triple
- Check if what you use from the package is simple enough to be abstracted

**Important**

- Is the package size acceptable for your project and goal?
- Is it tree-shakable?
- Does it have side effects?
- Does the package support TypeScript?
- Does it have a low number of dependencies? (and what are these dependencies?)
- Does it have a high number of stars / weekly downloads?
- Does it have a stable version? (Use of alpha and beta is discouraged)
- How large is the number of open issues in relation to the usage and age of the package?
- Are changes committed often and recent?
- What is the number of (active) collaborators?
- Does the license allow commercial use? (Or, you should get formal approval)

**Side notes**

- Handle any audit issues upon installation.
- Don't lock versions unless you really need to. Preferably use `^version`.
- Keep dependencies up to date and audited; check frequently.
- Making changes to packages is discouraged.
