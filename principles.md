# Principles

In order write a convention with consistent structur, rules and patterns, we have to state some main principles that we **want** and **have** to follow.

## Convention over configuration

We like React because it’s a less opinionated framework and let’s you configure a lot makes it able to create different patterns for similair solutions. However, this also creates different patterns for the same solution and therefore overhead. We’re creating this convention to minimize this overhead and make transitions to other projects easier.

## Abstraction over implementation

Try not to implement third party functionality straight into your code. Create abstracted helpers
